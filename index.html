    <h1 style="color:red;"><b>Fashion Forward: How Americans Spend on Apparel Represents a Progressing Society</h1></b>
   <p><i> Note: The dollar amounts referred to in this article have been adjusted for inflation, according to 2017 prices.<p></i>
      <p>
      <p>The apparel industry is a fickle one – fashion fads are revolving by the day, brands are quickly going mobile and retailers face pressure to keep up with the market demand. It’s no surprise that consumer expenditures towards apparel are subject to fluctuate as well. What an individual chooses to wear is one of the most open and uniquely personal forms of self-expression. Often, style can be indicators of personality, goals and even socioeconomic status, as well as reflections of an adapting society. In the last sixteen years, America has faced three polarizing presidents, a rise of a new feminist movement, a global recession and a burst of social media networks and technological innovations that collectively manifest in consumers’ individual choices, attitudes, and shopping habits. Consumers are redefining what fashion means to them, one item of apparel at a time, communicating to the world they are impacted by and adjusting to political, economic and social inequalities and progresses of the age.</p>

      <p>The American apparel market was valued at $218.4 billion USD in 2016, which grew 3% from the previous year. However, in 2016, the percentage of all consumer expenditures that went towards apparel was 3.1%, compared to 3.9% ten years prior. Business may be booming, but consumer expenditures in apparel have overall declined. The average amount consumers spent on apparel dropped 19% between 2006-2016. While apparel is clearly a necessity, the role it plays in society has shifted in recent years. It’s not that consumers do not prioritize shopping for clothes – it’s that the way they shop for them has changed.

      <p>Economically, spending on apparel has naturally plummeted since the 2008 recession, hitting an all-time low in 2013. However, the average yearly income for the average American has been steadily increasing since 2012, reaching $44,460 per year in 2016. In 2016, Americans have grown wealthier, the economy has improved (America’s GDP has been steadily increasing since 2009, reaching $18.57 trillion USD in 2016), inflation rates have reached its lowest at 1.6%, and unemployment rates have dropped down to roughly 4.9%. An affluent economy however does not equate increased expenditures. The amount that consumers spend on apparel is relatively low, as average apparel expenditures continue to decrease over time (despite a spike in growth in 2015).</p>
      <p>Culturally, versatility in fashion is one of the dynamic forces that has affected consumers since the millennium. More specifically, people are buying more versatile clothing that can be worn at any time, so it can cross over into a variety of weather conditions and occasions. The strict rules that once guided appropriate clothing types have loosened over time. For example, it’s become more socially acceptable to wear more relaxed, comfortable clothing for work. With the rise of the athleisure movement in the early 2010s, in which athletic clothing was popularized for everyday wear, the gaps between professional and leisure wears were starting to close. What people wear during the work week can also be worn casually for weekends or nights out as well.<p>
      <p>The apparel industry may be mostly targeted towards female consumers, but that does not mean that male consumers are unaffected. Rather, they simply spend their incomes on apparel differently. Income is a huge factor that influences spending, and disparities between income by gender is not to be ignored. As of 2016, the average woman makes 79 cents to the average man’s dollar. The gender pay gap is further reflected in the median weekly earnings by gender chart, where in 2016, the average man earned $940 per week ($48,880 per year) whereas the average woman earned $770 per week ($40,040 per year). Women may have less purchasing power than men do, due to income differences, but at the same time, expenditures for women’s clothing is significantly higher than those for men’s clothing.<p>

 <p>  The apparel industry may be mostly targeted towards female consumers, but that does not mean that male consumers are unaffected. Rather, men and women simply spend their incomes on apparel differently. Income is one factor that influences spending, and the disparities between income by gender is not to be ignored. As of 2016, the average woman earns roughly around 79 cents to the average man’s dollar. The gender pay gap is further reflected in the median weekly earnings by gender chart, where in 2016, the average man earned $940 per week ($48,880 per year) whereas the average woman earned $770 per week ($40,040 per year). Women may have less purchasing power than men do (due to income differences) but at the same time, expenditures for women’s clothing is significantly higher than those for men’s clothing despite steadily decreasing. Women have also spent more of their income on apparel than men up until 2005, but afterward, the percentage of income spent on apparel for men is higher than that of women. This is not to say that men are buying more apparel than women are, but rather that men continue to earn more than women do and the gender pay gap is nowhere close to closing.<p>

    <p>The percentage of income that men spend on apparel fluctuates very little in comparison to the rapidly decreasing percentage of income that women spend on apparel. This may be a reflection of how men’s fashion trends are relatively consistent; men’s apparel tends to be simpler and with less variety, such as two-piece suits, t-shirts or polos, shorts and pants that also overlap into different work or leisure occasions. On the other hand, there is more diversity in women’s fashion; from rompers to dresses and skirts to bras, there is no shortage of different types of women’s apparel. Women’s fashion has also always been considerably more divisive – as previously mentioned, apparel for work and leisure was always very separated. Today, flowy wide-leg culottes have replaced the more traditional straight-leg chinos, leggings can be worn as pants, pajamas have been rebranded as “coordinate sets,” and bras, or rather — the decision to wear them – have become more of a personal choice rather than a socialized necessity. Therefore, it is more likely that women are spending their income on pieces than can overlap similar to the way men’s fashion trends operates.<p>
